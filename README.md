# Engineer III Portfolio – Robert Teah

This portfolio showcases the real-world engineering work I’ve delivered as a DevOps/SRE/Cloud Platform Engineer.  
It includes medium-sized features, end-to-end project delivery, observability improvements, automation, and production-grade systems design.

Each project contains:
- Architecture diagrams
- Design decisions & tradeoffs
- Deployment workflows
- CI/CD pipelines
- Kubernetes/Infra code
- Runbooks & on-call documentation
- Production readiness notes
